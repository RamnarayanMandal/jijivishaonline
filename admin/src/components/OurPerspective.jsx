            India wears her beauty in the colorful textiles, breathtaking
            ornaments, and inspiring stories that come alive in her streets.
            There is magic in the hands that work the loom, in the eyes that
            pore over a needle, in the brushstrokes that paint life. And yet few
            things can sum it all up, can capture the essence in a box. At
            Jijivisha, we have begun a fascinating journey, a humble attempt to
            bring India a little closer to the world.
